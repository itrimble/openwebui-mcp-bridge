# Open WebUI MCP Bridge Configuration Guide

## üéØ Current Setup Status

‚úÖ **Open WebUI**: Running at http://localhost:3000 (Docker)  
‚úÖ **MCP Bridge**: Active with 10 endpoints on ports 11001-11010  
‚úÖ **MCP Dockmaster**: Running (PID: 20510)  
‚úÖ **All MCP Servers**: 92 active processes detected

## üìã Step-by-Step Open WebUI Configuration

### 1. Access Open WebUI Settings

1. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser
2. Sign in to your Open WebUI account
3. Click the **Settings** icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top right corner
4. Navigate to **Tools** in the left sidebar

### 2. Add MCP Tool Endpoints

For **Docker-based Open WebUI**, add these endpoints in **Settings > Tools**:

> **Important**: Since your Open WebUI is running in Docker and the MCP bridge is on the host, use `localhost` (not `host.docker.internal`) because the bridge is accessible from within the container.

## üß™ Verification & Testing

### Check MCP Bridge Status
```bash
# Test main endpoints
curl http://localhost:11001/health  # AppleScript
curl http://localhost:11002/health  # GitHub
curl http://localhost:11003/health  # Playwright
curl http://localhost:11004/health  # Notes
curl http://localhost:11005/health  # Screenshot
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "server": "applescript",
  "status": "ok", 
  "description": "macOS system automation and app control",
  "category": "system"
}
```

### Test Docker Network Access
```bash
# Verify Open WebUI can reach MCP endpoints
docker exec open-webui curl -s http://localhost:11001/health
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tools Not Appearing in Open WebUI
**Solution:**
1. Verify MCP bridge is running: `curl http://localhost:11001/health`
2. Check Docker network: `docker exec open-webui curl http://localhost:11001/health`
3. Restart Open WebUI if needed: `docker restart open-webui`

### Issue: "Connection Refused" Errors
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all MCP servers are running: `ps aux | grep mcp`
2. Check MCP Dockmaster status: `ps aux | grep mcp-proxy-server`
3. Restart MCP bridge if needed: `cd ~/Desktop/mcp-openwebui-bridge && ./setup-mcp-bridge.sh`

### Issue: Tool Execution Fails
**Solution:**
1. Check individual tool health: `curl http://localhost:1100X/health`
2. Verify permissions (especially for AppleScript)
3. Test tools individually before using in conversations

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### System Automation
```
"Use AppleScript to open Finder and create a new folder on my Desktop called 'Project Files'"
